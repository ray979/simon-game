# Summary
The Simon game.

06/15/2023:
Fixed issue where a double click of the correct color at the end of the current sequence/level should be game over, but the game level still displays and was incremented after game over effects.
Ex. Current level is 1 and the sequence is [yellow]. The user clicked yellow very quickly. It should say game over and stay the same until the user restarts the game, but level 2 is displayed after the game over effects.
